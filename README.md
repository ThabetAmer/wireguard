# WireGuard Setup

WireGuard is a fast and secure VPN protocol, easy to configure and deploy.
This repository automates the setup of WireGuard VPN on a Linux server over AWS EC2.

## Features

- Automatic installation of WireGuard.
- Configuration of WireGuard server interface.
- Generation of server and peer keys.
- Hot pluggable via s3 bucket for persistant storage of configs
- Many-to-Many client-server mapping

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following:

- AWS CLI 2+
- (optional) AWS CDK 2+ or Terraform 1.9+ with hashicorp/aws provider 4+

## Initiation

You need to set functional Wireguard on a server, here EC2, with method to sync configs to server.

- Create S3 bucket - where the VPN configs for server and peers are stored
  - Versioning would be in benefit to track changes to configs over time
- Create EC2 instance
  - Preferably T3/T4 burstable small size - no need for the more expensive allocations
  - Linux based - _of course_, here we use the AMAZON_LINUX_2 AMI image
  - A persistant IP is needed as address for public access
- Link the EC2 with a security group with UDP 51820 port is publically open
- Link the EC2 with S3 access via IAM policy statement
- Install necessary apps and configs on operating system
  - Docker and Docker compose
  - cronjob daemon
  - modprobe and IP forwarding
  - files and scripts: cron sync script, compose file and its env file.

### CDK Automotion for infrastructure as code
In smoother way for automation, a CDK stack template is attached in file [WireGuardEc2Stack.java](WireGuardEc2Stack.java), with inititation script for ec2 userdata attached as will [userdata-bastion-wireguard.sh](userdata-bastion-wireguard.sh), where few variables have to be set in advance.


Variables in _WireGuardEc2Stack.java_
```java
private final String bastionWireguardBucketName = "your-s3-bucket-name";
private final String bastionWireguardKeyPairName = "your-key-pair-name";

private final String ec2InstanceType = "BURSTABLE2";
private final String ec2InstanceSize = "SMALL";
```

Variables in _userdata-bastion-wireguard.sh_
```bash
S3_BUCKET_NAME=MY_S3_BUCKET
VPN_URL=MY_VPN_DOMAIN
VPN_PEER=MY_VPN_PEER
```

### Terraform Automotion for infrastructure as code

Same as in the CDK sample, a separate module for Terraform has been embedded in folder `terraform-module`, make sure to set variables before calling the resource, not only in `variables.tf` but also for the user-data file in root file `userdata-bation-wireguard.sh`
```
environment_name
vpc_id
vpc_subnet_id
allowed_security_groups_ingress
dns_zone_id
dns_name
ssh_key_name
s3_bucket_name
instance_profile
```

With default values for:
```bash
port_number=51820
ami=ami-031b673f443c2172c
instance_type=t3a.small
private_subnet_cidr=10.1.0.0/16
```

## Server Setup

To set configs for a server, follow the procedure:

- Run script below with the server profile name
```bash
./set-profile.sh profile_name
```
- It will creates a env file template for the profile, go ahead and edit the provided file, namely `profile_name.env`
  - `SERVER_ENDPOINT` is the public IP/DNS name for the server
  - `ALLOWED_IPS` are the CIDR for internal server network to access, ie "192.168.1.0/16 10.0.0.0/24"
  - `PEERS` is a list of clients allowed to connect - here we use generic prefix for all
  - `BUCKET_NAME` s3 bucket name to store configs on
  - `SERVER_PORT` mainly 51820
  - `GATEWAY_IP` mainly is the internal IP of VPN server 10.0.0.1

- Rerun the same script again `./set-profile.sh profile_name` to enject the configs you've just set in previous step.
  - Creates dedicated folder under profile/configs/ with server keys and configs in
  - It also takes care of internal DNS resolution via coreDNS


## Manage Clients

### User Addition

To add a peer (client) to your WireGuard server, run the script below, it will ask for your confirmation on submitting the new addition to s3 bucket folder

```bash
./adduser.sh profile_name peer_name
```
- Creates new client public/private keys for new auto incremented internal IP address.
- Syncs from S3 bucket as the soruce of configs, then syncs back to when the new client is added.

Make sure to securely distribute the clientâ€™s private key and connection configuration for them to connect to the server.

### User Deletion

To delete a peer (client), run the scipt below, it will automatically sync with s3 for permanent removal of client

```bash
./deluser.sh profile_name peer_name
```
